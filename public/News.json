Probably. But we're going to stick with Taylor for now,\" Rivera said. Heinicke and the entire Washington Football Team were an utter disaster in the 56-14 loss to the division-rival Dallas Cowboys on Sunday night. Heinicke went just 7-for-22 for 121 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions in the blowout loss. He was replaced in the second half by Allen, who went 8-for-10 for 67 yards and a touchdown. The Washington offense should have a better game in Week 17 against the Eagles, but Philly's secondary has been respectable this year, and neither Heinicke nor Allen will be attractive as QB2s.",
